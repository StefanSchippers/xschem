 <h1>EDITOR COMMANDS</h1><br>
 <p>
  Most editing commands are available in the menu, but definitely key-bindings and Mouse actions
  are the most effective way to build and arrange schematics, so you should learn at least the 
  most important ones.
 </p>

 <h2> INTUITIVE INTERFACE </h2>
 <p> This is a recent interface that uses less keyboard commands and more mouse actions
  It is therefore possible to click and drag objects directly and do many more actions
  by just using mouse actions. This interface is enabled by enabling the menu checkbutton:<br>
  <kbd>Options -&gt; Intuitive click &amp; Drag Interface</kbd><br>
  Or by adding the following line:<br>
 <kbd>set intuitive_interface 1</kbd><br>
  in your <kbd>xschemrc</kbd> file.
 </p>
 <p> The following cheatsheet image shows the intuitive_interface commands</p>
 <img src="intuitive_interface_cheatsheet.svg">
 <p> 
  The standard interface is described below. All below description applies also if
  intuitive_interface is enabled.
 </p>

 <h2> STANDARD INTERFACE </h2>
 <p>
  The basic principle in XSCHEM is that first you select something in the circuit then you
  decide what to do with the selection.
  For example, if you need to change an object property you first select it (mouse click) and then
  you press the edit property (<kbd>'q'</kbd>) key.
  It you need to move together multiple objects you select them (by area or using multiple mouse
  clicks with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key), then you press the move (<kbd>'m'</kbd>) key.

                        (line, rectangle, symbol, wire)
                        if clicking on blank area: clear selection

shift + LeftButton      Select without clearing previous selection

ctrl + LeftButton       if an 'url' or 'tclcommand' property is defined on 
                        selected instance open the url or execute the 
                        tclcommand

LeftButton drag         Select objects by area, clearing previous selection
                        "[shift] left button drag" and "[shift] ctrl-left
                        button drag" commands are swapped if enable_stretch
                        is set.

Ctrl + LeftButton drag  Select objects by area to perform a 
                        subsequent   'stretch'  move operation

shift + LeftButton drag Select objects by area, without clearing 
                        previous selection

 <h3>KEYBIND CUSTOMIZATION</h3>
 <p>
  changes to default keybindings may be placed in the <kbd>~/.xschem/xschemrc</kbd> file as in the following examples:
 </p>
 <pre class="code">
## replace Ctrl-d with Escape (so you won't kill the program :-))
set replace_key(Control-d) Escape
## swap w and W keybinds; Always specify Shift for capital letters
set replace_key(Shift-W) w
set replace_key(w) Shift-W
 </pre><br>

 <a id="select"><h3>SELECT OBJECTS</h3></a>
 <p>
  Objects can be selected by clicking the left mouse button when the pointer is very close to the object.
  For rectangle objects the best point to select it is the internal side, close to one of the corners.
  More objects can be selected by pressing the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and clicking another object.
  Once objects are selected they can be copied (<kbd>c</kbd> key), moved (<kbd>m</kbd> key), deleted
  (<kbd>Delete</kbd> key) or attributes changed (<kbd>q</kbd> key).<br>
  Objects can also be selected by area, by dragging with the left mouse button pressed a rectangle around the objects 
  you want to select.
 </p>
 <img src="commands9.png">
 <a id="resize"><h3>RESIZE OBJECTS</h3></a>
 <p>
  All Xschem base objects can be resized.
  For lines, rectangles, polygons you need to drag the mouse with left button pressed and Ctrl key pressed 
  over one vertex/endpoint.
 </p>
 <img src="commands6.png">
 <p>
  After releasing the mouse button the object will become selected
  and a subsequent move operation (<kbd>m</kbd> key) will move the selected vertex/endpoint.
 </p>
 <img src="commands7.png">
 <p>
  More objects can be resized. You can add vertex/endpoints by pressing Ctrl and Shift and dragging the mouse 
  to enclose another vertex/endpoint. After selecting all desired elements pressing the <kbd>m</kbd> key
  will resize all objects.
 </p>
 <img src="commands8.png">
 <p>
  Circles can be resized as well. Capture the center of the circle with the above described mouse drag operation, the radius can be changed.
  For arcs you can capture the center (to modify the radius) or the endpoints to change the start/end angle or the arc angle.
 </p>
 <h3>STRETCH OPERATIONS</h3>
 <p>
  An important operation that deserves a special paragraph is the <kbd>Stretch</kbd> operation.
  There is frequently the need to move part of the circuit without breaking connections, for 
  example to create more room for other circuitry or just to make it look better.
  The first thing to do is to drag a selection rectangle with the mouse holding down the
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key, cutting wires we need to stretch:
 </p>
 <img src="commands1.png">
 <p>
  After selection is done hit the move (<kbd>'m'</kbd>) key. You will be able to move the selected part
  of the schematic keeping connected the wires crossing the selection rectangle:
 </p>
 <img src="commands2.png">
 <p>
  In our example we needed to move up part of the circuit, the end result is shown in next picture. 
  Multiple stretch rectangles can be set using the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key in addition to the 
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key after setting the first stretch area.
 </p>
 <img src="commands3.png">

 <p> Another way to move objects stretching attached wires is to press <kbd>Ctrl-m</kbd> instead of <kbd>m</kbd>
     This way you don't have to remember to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> when doing the selection.</p>

 <p> Pressing <kbd>Shift-m</kbd> instead of <kbd>m</kbd> will create new wires while moving the selected objects.</p>
 <img src="commands10.png">

 <h3>PLACE, WIRES MANHATTAN PATHS</h3>
 <p> When you press the <kbd>w</kbd> key a wire placement begins. Moving the mouse a rubber wire is displayed.
  Clicking the left mouse button will end the wire placement. If the space bar is pressed you toggle between
  Horizontal-Vertical, Vertical-Horizontal and oblique placement mode.</p>
 <img src="commands14.png">

 <h3>PLACE WIRES SNAPPING TO CLOSEST PIN OR NET ENDPOINT</h3>
 <p>
  The (uppercase) <kbd>'W'</kbd> bindkey allows to place a wire putting start (and end point, later) to the 
  closest pin or wire endpoint, this will make it easier to connect precisely without the need to zoom in all times.
 </p><br>
 <h3>CONSTRAINED MOVE</h3>
 <p>
  while creating wires, lines, and moving, stretching, copying objects, pressing the <kbd>'h'</kbd> or <kbd>'v'</kbd> keys 
  will constrain the movement to a horizontal or vertical direction, respectively.
 </p> 
 <img src="commands4.png" style="margin-bottom: 0px;" >
 <p style="padding-top:0px;"> <i>
  Constrained horizontal move: regardless of the mouse pointer Y position movement 
  occurs on the X direction only.
 </i></p>
 <img src="commands5.png" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
 <p style="padding-top:0px;"> <i>
  Unconstrained move: objects follow the mouse pointer in X and Y direction.
 </i></p>
 <h3>POLYGON EDITING COMMANDS</h3>
 <p> There are some specific editing modes for polygons. A polygon is created by pressing the <kbd>p</kbd> key.
  After dragging the first segment a mouse button clock will create the second point and so on.
  A double click ends the placement.<br>
  If a polygon is selected the control points are shown with circles. These circles can be dragged with the
  mouse directly.</p>
 <img src="commands11.png">
 <p> Clicking one control point with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key will add a new point in the polygon shape:</p>
 <img src="commands12.png">
 <p> Clicking one control point with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key will delete a point in the polygon shape.</p>
 <p> Adding attribute <kbd>bezier=true</kbd> or  <kbd>bezier=1</kbd> will transform the polygon into a bezier
  curve with the polygon points acting as control points.</p>
